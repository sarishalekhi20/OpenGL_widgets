Open Graphics Library as defined above is an open-source, cross-platform graphics API (Application Programming Interface) that allows us to create 2D and 3D computer graphics.

It has a set of functions and commands that you need to have a thorough knowledge of in order to interact with the graphics hardware of the computer 
It provides abstraction by hiding complexities of interacting with different graphics hardware and provides a consistent interface for developers to create visually rich and interactive applications.

With OpenGL, developers can define geometric shapes, apply textures and materials, specify lighting conditions, and perform scaling, rotation, and translation transformations. It also supports various rendering techniques, including rasterization, shading, and blending, to create realistic and visually appealing graphics.

I have used openGL to make few widgets using the  functions provided by it like vertex2f and vertex3f also line and polygon-making functions for not filled and filled widgets respectively 

I later did extensive research on how the openGL API works and interacts with the widgets by using different functions and layers of processing it is almost 8 step process
